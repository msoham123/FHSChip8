# FHSChip8

An experimental CHIP-8 intepreter designed to serve as a learning experience for members of the Fremont High School Programming Club.

## Introduction

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers

There are a number of classic video games ported to CHIP-8, such as Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris, and Pac-Man. There are also applications like a random maze generator and Conway's Game of Life.

## Contribute

For classes, use PascalCase. For variables and and methods, use camelCase. Constants should be upper case. Create header files for any classes you create. 

Clone the project, checkout to a new branch, and submit a PR which will then be reviewed before being merged into master. A PR must address an issue. If there isn't one, create a new issue and mention it in your PR.

## Usage

With a clone of the repo, C++23, and CMAKE, you can run this project by manually using CMAKE build or use CLion.
